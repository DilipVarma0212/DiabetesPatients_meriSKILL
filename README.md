# DiabetesPatients_meriSKILL

Project Summary: This project focused on analyzing Diabetes Patients data, this project is given by  "MeriSKILL". This dataset originally form the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the datasets.


Steps Followed:

    Data Cleaning: Remove all errors, inconsistencies and duplicates data from data sheet.
    Data Processing: Prepared the data for analysis by organizing and formatting it appropriately.
    Data Analysis: Employed various analytical techniques to derive insights and draw meaningful conclusions.
    Data Visualization: Presented the findings in a visually appealing manner through charts and graphs.
    Reports: Compiled a comprehensive Dashboard to  summarizing the analysis and its outcomes.


Key Question of the dashboard :

    What is the Total Patients and Total Insulin Level ?
    Waht is the Average Age, BMI, Blood Pressure resp ?
    Waht is the Average Skin Thickness, Glucose Level resp ?
    What is the percentage comparison by Outcomes  ?
    What is the percentage comparison by Age Group  ?
    Which Glucose Category is highest ?
    Which Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF) Category is highest ?


Insight of the dashboard :

    Total Patients is 336 & Total Insulin Level is 52K.
    Average Age is 32, Average BMI is 32.30, Average Blood Pressure is 70.24.
    Average Skin Thickness is 28.66, Average Glucose Level is 122.
    For Non-Diabetes, percentage comparison by Outcomes is 55% and for Diabetes percentage comparison by Outcomes is 45%.
    In Group 1 i.e. age between 18-30 is 59.23%, in Group 2 i.e. age between 31-45 is 27.98%, in Group 1 i.e. age between 46-60 is 11.9% and in Group 4 i.e. age between above 60 is 
    0.89% resp.
    Pre-Glucose Category is highest of 167 followed by Normal and Diabetes Category resp.
    Low Risk Category is highest of 192 followed by Moderate & High Risk resp.
